twitterStream manipulation

This is my test with twitterStream

This is a private project.The idea is to create a candidate list of twitterusers by analysing tweets filtered by search keywords. There will be options to load twitterkeywords, save tweets, analyse tweets and users.

achievements
1. multiple twitter accounts
2. automatically switch to other account on rate limit exception
3. collect tweets and information
4. used xml configuration for twitter authentication

goals
1. add timely schedules for tweet collection (using quartz scheduler)
2. process tweets and find candidate users to follow (point system in thought)
3. keywords and it's ranking (needs clarity)
4. Restful webservices for data, scheduler, settings / configuration and twitter functions
5. better extendability (not in plan at the moment)
